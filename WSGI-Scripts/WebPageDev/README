So the plan is  pyhton inheritance if i can use it to build a
idea or passing system that will build the webpage much like
a xml passer.

the python inheritance looks simple enough so this should go fine.

Possible class require:
    image
    text
    title
    banner
    line break
    bar
    div

fun things will be making them able to contain elements into themself.
